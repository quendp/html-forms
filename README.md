### Description 
This project is also a requirement to our coding bootcamp. The main task is to 
utilize various HTML form elements as creatively as possible. This time around, 
I tried using css animations through keyframes and transitions, experimented on
the parallax effect using CSS, and played around with JavaScript to perform form
validations, tabs, and a few animations.

As a beginner, this is very challenging considering that we also have a time limit
and I am just starting to learn JS on my own. Obviously, my codes are very inefficient
and messy but as of now, I'll let it serve as a room for improvement for my next
project. It is also my goal to increase the level of difficulty after every activity
and so far, I was able to maintain that upward trend. For me, the most challenging
part on this one is the coding of JS, but fortunately, I am now starting to get the
hang of it. Lastly, I hope you'll like my work. 



### Time Spent
Two (2) days

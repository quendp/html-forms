**_Date:_** November 19, 2022

**_Description:_** This project is also a requirement to our coding bootcamp. The main task is to utilize various HTML form elements as creatively as possible. This time around, I tried using css animations through keyframes and transitions, experimented on the parallax effect using CSS, and played around with JavaScript to perform form validations, tabs, and a few animations. <br>
As a beginner, this is very challenging considering that we also have a time limit and I am just starting to learn JS on my own. Obviously, my codes are very inefficient messy but as of now, I'll let it serve as a room for improvement for my next project. It is also my goal to increase the level of difficulty after every activity and so far, I was able to maintain that upward trend. For me, the most challenging part on this one is the coding of JS, but fortunately, I am now starting to get the hang of it. Lastly, I hope you'll like my work. 

**_Time Spent:_** Two (2) days
